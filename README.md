# Separating glioma hyperintensities from white matter by tensor-valued diffusion MRI
Code to the manuscript in prep: *Separating glioma hyperintensities from white matter by tensor-valued diffusion MRI*.

Data accessibility: Available is code used to process raw data (nifty files) from the scanner in the folder Process. The summary of the output data is available in the folder data (images themselves not publicly available but are upon reasonable request). The published data is enough to produce SIR distributio but not images.

Data processed and visualized by *md-dmri: multidimensional toolbox* available at: https://github.com/markus-nilsson/md-dmri (version published 27.Jan.2020). 

Analyzed using *MATLAB 2020a*. Images viewed by mdm-gui in *Matlab 2019a* (a version of md-dmri that can show 4 different modalities in 1 window simultaneously, mdm-dmri shows only 1 modality simultaneously, it is not publicly available but can be provided).
